How to launch:
  1. clone repo
  2. open cmd in the root of the project
  3. execute command "npm ci"
  4. execute command "gulp"
  5. then browser opens the website, but if some images are not uploaded, refresh the page 
     (it's because in the gulp pipeline open the page goes first, and upload and minimize pictures goes after)
